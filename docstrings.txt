- `knorm`: wavenumber in the medium.
- `kr`: 2D float array of size ``N\times 3`` containing the dimensionless position ``k\mathbf{r}`` of each dipole.
- `e_inc`: 2D complex array of size ``N\times 3`` containing the incident electric field ``\mathbf{E}_{i}`` on each dipole.
- `phi_inc`: 2D complex array of size ``N\times 6`` containing the incident electric and magnetic field ``\mathbf{\phi}=(\mathbf{E}_i,\mathbf{H}_i)`` on each dipole.
- `alpha_e_dl`: complex dimensionless electric polarizability of each dipole. See the Alphas module documentation for accepted formats.
- `alpha_m_dl`: complex dimensionless magnetic polarizability of each dipole. See the Alphas module documentation for accepted formats.
- `alpha_dl`: 6x6 complex dimensionless electric and magnetic polarizability of each dipole. See the Alphas module documentation for accepted formats.
