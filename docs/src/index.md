# CoupledElectricMagneticDipoles.jl

Welcome on the documentation website for the coupled electric and magnetic dipoles method implementation in Julia! On this website, you will find all the description of the functions implemented in this library. Please read carefully the next sections in order to be ready to code with CoupledElectricMagneticDipoles.jl!

## How to use this website
This website is divided in three parts. The first one is the theory tab, in which you will be able to find the derivations of all the formulas that are used in this software. The, 7 tabs are dedicated to the 7 submodules of the software. Finally, the example tab gives two examples for the use of this library.

## Sub-Modules
There are the 7 submodules of the library:
- DDACore: Contains the functions to solve the coupled dipoles system of equations.
- GreenTensors: Contains functions to compute the electric and magnetic or both green tensors.
- Alphas: Small library to compute the polarisabilities.
- Geometries: Small library to discretize some 3d objects or to generate some 3D random structures.
- MieCoeff: Contains functions to compute the Mie coefficients.
- PostProcessing: Small library used to compute the scattering, absorption and extinction cross sections, as well as the scattered field.
- InputFields: Small library with functions for input fields (plane waves,...).
