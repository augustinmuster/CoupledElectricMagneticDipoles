# DDAjulia

The aim of this code is to provide a quick and easy to use DDA implementation of electric or electric and magnetic dipoles. This code run in parrallel (for some parts) and the GPu acceleration is on process.

## Sub-Modules
- DDA: core funxtionalities of the DDA
- GreenTensors: to compute the electric and magnetic or both green tensors.
- Alpha: to compute the polarizabilities.
- Geometries: to discretize some 3d objects or to generate some 3D random structures.
- MieCoeff: everythiong that has to do with Mie theory

## Units

## Example
The code is know provided with two example:
-
