# Green Tensors

This module is aimed to compute the electric and magnetic green tensors for the two system of units.

## Module Features
- Computes the electric/magnetic green tensor.
- Computes the electric/magnetic green tensor for renormalized units.
- Compute the big electric and magnetic green tensor.
- Compute the big electric and magnetic for renormalized units.
- Compute the derivatives of the electric/magnetic/big green tensor.
